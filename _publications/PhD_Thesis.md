Abstract: This dissertation explores the interplay between higher categorical structures and algebraic K-theory, focusing on refining Waldhausen’s K-theory via monoidal bicategories and Picard 2-groupoids. We study algebraic models for connected n-types of K-theory spaces, with emphasis on the 2-type and 3-type. We construct monoidal bicategories from Waldhausen categories and lift the K-theory to a functor that encodes multiplicative and coherence data. Using stabilized quadratic modules, we model the connected 3-type and define a universal 2-determinant functor valued in a Picard 2-groupoid. In the second part, we analyze symmetric monoidal bicategories using categorical extensions and biextensions. Extending previous work by Breen, we relate symmetric structures to alternating biextensions and compute associated cohomological invariants via quadratic functors. We provide a full cocycle-level analysis of the classifying invariants in Eilenberg–MacLane cohomology, giving explicit quadratic functors that capture the higher coherence conditions associated with the symmetry structure. These results advance the structural understanding of algebraic K-theory and reveal new connections between homotopical algebra, higher monoidal categories, and cohomological classification of categorical symmetries.
