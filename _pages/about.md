I have a Ph.D. in Pure Math from [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/). I have a strong background in abstract reasoning, probability, and quantitative analysis. I am now pivoting to the financial industry, where I aim to apply my analytical skills and mathematical training to quantitative research, trading, and data-driven financial modeling. I’m particularly interested in systematic strategies, risk modeling, and the mathematical foundations of market behavior.

**Past**: My doctoral research is in the field of pure math, mainly in topics like K-theory, category theory, and homotopy theory. I worked on my dissertation with [Dr. Ettore Aldrovandi](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov/).
I previously completed my master's degree in math from [IISER, Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/academic/departments/#gsc.tab=0) with [Dr. Somnath Basu](https://math.iiserkol.ac.in/faculties/somnath_basu.html) as my advisor on a study of topological K-theory. 

This semester:
 - I am teaching college algebra to three classes as an adjunct faculty at [Tallahassee State College](https://www.tsc.fl.edu/academics/academic-divisions/science-and-mathematics/).
 - I am working as a math expert at Project Rainforest at [Mercor](https://work.mercor.com/home?tab=contracts).

Apart from research in math, I am an amateur trader. I enjoy playing pool, volleyball, and squash. I also like hiking and photography.
