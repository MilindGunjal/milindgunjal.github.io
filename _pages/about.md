I am a 5^{th} year graduate student at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/). I study pure math, and I am interested in topics like K-theory, category theory, and homotopy theory. I work with [Dr. Ettore Aldrovandi](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov/).
Previously I did my masters from [IISER, Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/academic/departments/#gsc.tab=0) with [Dr. Somnath Basu](https://math.iiserkol.ac.in/faculties/somnath_basu.html) as my advisor. The title of my master's thesis was [vector bundles from an algebraic viewpoint](/files/Thesis_Final.pdf). 

This semester, I am the administrative TA for the [math department](https://www.math.fsu.edu/).
