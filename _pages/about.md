I am a 5th year Ph.D. student at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/). My research interest is in the field of pure math, mainly in topics like K-theory, category theory, and homotopy theory. I am currently working on my doctoral thesis with [Dr. Ettore Aldrovandi](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov/).
I previously completed my master's degree in math from [IISER, Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/academic/departments/#gsc.tab=0) with [Dr. Somnath Basu](https://math.iiserkol.ac.in/faculties/somnath_basu.html) as my advisor on a study of topological K-theory. 

This semester:
 - The administrative TA for the [math department](https://www.math.fsu.edu/).
 - Studying Stable Homotopy theory at [eCHT](https://s.wayne.edu/echt/echt-courses/stable-homotopy-theory-winter-2024/).
 - Group discussions on applied category theory.

Apart from research in math, I am an amateur trader. I enjoy playing pool, volleyball, and squash. I also like hiking and photography.
