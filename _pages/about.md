I have a Ph.D. in Pure Math from [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/). I have a strong background in abstract reasoning, probability, and quantitative analysis. I am now pivoting to the financial industry, where I aim to apply my analytical skills and mathematical training to quantitative research, trading, and data-driven financial modeling. Iâ€™m particularly interested in systematic strategies, risk modeling, and the mathematical foundations of market behavior.

**Past**: My doctoral research is in the field of pure math, mainly in topics like K-theory, category theory, and homotopy theory. I worked on my dissertation with [Dr. Ettore Aldrovandi](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~ealdrov/).
I previously completed my master's degree in math from [IISER, Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/academic/departments/#gsc.tab=0) with [Dr. Somnath Basu](https://math.iiserkol.ac.in/faculties/somnath_basu.html) as my advisor on a study of topological K-theory. 

This semester:
 - The administrative TA for the [math department](https://www.math.fsu.edu/).

Apart from research in math, I am an amateur trader. I enjoy playing pool, volleyball, and squash. I also like hiking and photography.
